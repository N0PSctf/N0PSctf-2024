### Solution

We are provided with a black and white photo showing a street lamp and 4 people in it. 
This does not give us many clues about its location, but let's try to use the Google Images Search to start. 
The search gives us the following [result](https://www.londonfineartphotography.co.uk/lisbon/) from the London Fine Art Photography Website among the similar images. Hence, our place is located in Portugal, Lisbon.
  
We use again the Google Images Search to find out more about the photo we found on the London Fine Art Photography Website depicting the same place. Among the results, we see the following [link](https://www.alamyimages.fr/photos-images/vue-a%C3%A9rienne-de-la-place-du-commerce-de-lisbonne.html?sortBy=relevant) bringing forward _Place du commerce lisbonne_ which represents the location of the place we are searching.     

We perform a quick Google Search to verify the location and we find out that its original name is **Praça do Comércio** which will be our flag. (We also respect the format given in the description)


### Flag

`N0PS{praca-do-comercio}`
