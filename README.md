## N0PSctf 

The first edition of N0PSctf was hosted on June 1st and 2nd, attracting over 1,000 participants from around the globe. The competition spanned 36 intense hours, during which our participants became experts in Japanese bridges. The team PWNSec emerged victorious, marking a significant achievement as it was their first Capture the Flag (CTF) competition, just like it was ours.

## Storyline 
In the echoing corridors, a phrase whispered among students held the allure of a secret incantation - Jojo. It was a name that carried weight, spoken with hushed reverence, yet veiled in mystery like a cyberlegend waiting to be unveiled.

Legend whispers of Jojo, rumored to be a digital virtuoso capable of manipulating code with unparalleled finesse. Yet, as anticipation mounts, a twist of fate sends shockwaves through the digital realm, vanishing Jojo without a trace. Left in Jojo's wake are mere whispers and conjecture, as if the legend itself had dissolved into the shadows of cyberspace, daring the world to uncover the truth.
